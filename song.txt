"Cheers To Youth (청춘찬가)"

[English translation:]

It just so happens we're facing today for the first time
Even if you hate yourself more from the deeply hurtful remarks you said
Let's not worry about it
With our voices, wherever we are, let's sing
Cheers to youth
One, two
One, two, three, four

I get scared when the bell rings
These days, my heart is shocked first
I want to be alone, I don't want to be alone
I don't even know myself

Where on earth is my happiness?
No one can answer
I want to talk while looking at my reflection on the turned off phone screen

He told me for his hard work on the way home today
It wasn't easy, but it wasn't bad
In this suffocating world
I laughed for a moment at one small thing

It just so happens we're facing today for the first time
Even if you hate yourself more from the deeply hurtful remarks you said
Let's not worry about it
With our voices, wherever we are, let's sing
Cheers to youth

My
My
My
My
My
My
Cozy blanket that wrapped in this little warmth
I'll fall asleep again while waiting for tomorrow

A loud alarm that rings tomorrow morning
I hope you don't hate me even a little more than yesterday
In this suffocating world
It must be so nice because all of this is me

Even if tomorrow is the first time we meet
Even if I hate you even more because of a single word that hurts so much
Let's not worry about it
With our voices, wherever we are, let's sing
Cheers to youth
